// Read-along stories for young readers (K–2 level).
//
// Distinct from the battle-based Story Mode in server-modules/story.js
// — those run combat encounters; this is a quiet reading experience
// designed to help kids practice. Each story has 4-6 sections of short
// sentences, repeated patterns, and high-frequency vocabulary.
//
// Audio: each section names a `speaker` (creature name). When the
// ElevenLabs TTS pipeline runs (slice 5b), it generates an MP3 per
// section using a voice ID assigned to the speaker, then caches the
// public URL in `audioUrl`. Until then `audioUrl` is null and the
// UI hides the "Read aloud" button gracefully.
