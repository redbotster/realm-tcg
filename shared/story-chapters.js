// Story-mode chapter data + boss specs.
//
// Three regular chapters + one finale. Each chapter has:
//   id, name, locale (display), intro (narrative blurbs), boss spec,
//   reward shape (picks + biased types / guaranteed legendary).
//
// Bosses are NOT regular cards — they have phases (HP threshold → new
// behavior), scripted attack patterns, and AoE moves that hit both players.
// The story engine reads these specs and applies them.
//
// Server uses this to: build the boss "card", advance phases, and roll
// chapter-specific rewards. Client uses it to render intros + UI.
