// Spell cards — non-creature cards that share the deck and trigger a
// one-shot effect when played, then go to discard. Mixed into the same
// deck as creature (no separate champion-card pile), drop through the
// same rarity-based reward system, and play through engine.playCard()
// just like creature — the engine branches on `card.kind`.
//
// Energy cost is derived from a card's `power` rating (higher power →
// more energy). Rarity is hand-picked per card to fit the difficulty
// drop ladder: medium-difficulty wins can pull common/uncommon/rare
// spells (5 of 6 defined here); hard wins pull epic/legendary (the
// board-wipe AOE).
//
// Effects:
//   freeze   — lock one enemy creature for 1 turn (no attack, no act)
//   paralyze — lock one enemy creature for 1 turn (chained on `paralyze` status)
//   heal     — restore one of your creature to full HP
//   defender — +5 max HP to one of yours AND must-be-attacked-first this match
//   evolve   — +50% Max HP and +50% Attack to one of yours
//   aoe      — deal `aoeDamage` to every enemy on the field
//
// Targeting:
//   target = "enemyField" → caller picks an enemy slot
//   target = "ownField"   → caller picks one of their own slots
//   target = "none"       → no slot pick (AOE)
//
// Costs (ceil(power / 2)):
//   power 2 → 1 energy
//   power 4 → 2 energy
//   power 6 → 3 energy
//   power 8 → 4 energy
